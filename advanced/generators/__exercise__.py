# Exercise
# Write a generator function which returns the Fibonacci series. They are calculated using the following formula: The first two numbers of the series is always equal to 1, and each consecutive number returned is the sum of the last two numbers. Hint: Can you use only two variables in the generator function? Remember that assignments can be done simultaneously. The code

# fill in this function
def fib():
    pass #this is a null statement which does nothing when executed, useful as a placeholder.

# testing code
import types
if type(fib()) == types.GeneratorType:
    print("Good, The fib function is a generator.")

    counter = 0
    for n in fib():
        print(n)
        counter += 1
        if counter == 10:
            break
