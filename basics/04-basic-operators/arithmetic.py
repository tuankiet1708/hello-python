# Arithmetic Operators
# Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.
number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print(number)

# Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.
remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)

# Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)
